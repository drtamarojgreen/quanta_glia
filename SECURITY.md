## Reporting a Vulnerability

The PrismQuanta team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our projects. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at `security@prismquanta.lab` with a detailed description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, and any other relevant information.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will send you a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
