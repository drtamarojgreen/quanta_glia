# Evaluation and improvement plan for quanta_glia

## Quick take

*   **What’s compelling**: Clear metaphor (glial pruning), sharp scope (spawning/pruning/annotating/curating), and an ambitious roadmap (recursive bootstrapping, federated pruning, ethics integration, dashboard). The README sketches triggers, policies, and naming conventions that make the behavior legible at scale.
*   **What’s missing**: A concrete architecture with interfaces, schemas, examples, tests, CI, release process, and an observable runtime. The repo lacks topics, releases, and a published license file; the README references PrismQuanta policies but doesn’t ship an explicit LICENSE/SECURITY document in-repo.

## Strengths to build on

*   **Well-defined core functions**: Repository Spawner, Pruner, Semantic Annotator, Knowledge Curator, Trigger-based behavior—this is a solid operational loop to formalize into modules and services.
*   **Roadmap alignment**: Recursive self-improvement, distributed coordination, ethical regulation, visual interface—these map cleanly to architectural seams you can design now and implement iteratively.
*   **Ecosystem hooks**: Integration points with QuantaSensa, QuantaEthos, QuantaParent, and an LLM backend (LLaMA.cpp) give you a place to anchor telemetry, policy, and reasoning calls.
*   **Clear conventions**: YAML-driven config, sandbox-only spawning, and naming conventions for spawned/archived repos reduce ambiguity in automation.

## Highest‑impact gaps and fixes (priority order)

1.  **Ship an explicit license, security posture, and contribution scaffolding**
    *   Add `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The README mentions ethics/audit policies but users need enforceable, versioned in‑repo docs for trust and adoption.
    *   Add repository topics and a short description for discoverability on GitHub.

2.  **Define a crisp architecture with typed interfaces**
    *   Break into modules: `core/`, `spawner/`, `pruner/`, `annotator/`, `curator/`, `policy/`, `triggers/`, `storage/`, `scheduler/`, `api/`, `ui/`.
    *   Publish interface contracts (Protocol/ABC) for each boundary so components can be mocked and swapped.

3.  **Codify data models and schemas**
    *   Create typed models for `RepoRecord`, `UsageMetrics`, `SimilarityScore`, `PruneDecision`, `SpawnRequest`, `PolicyVerdict`.
    *   Validate YAML config against a schema; add defaults and strict type checking.

4.  **Observability and auditability from day one**
    *   Structured logs with correlation IDs, immutable audit logs for decisions, and metrics for spawn/prune outcomes.
    *   A simple dashboard (even a minimal API + page) to visualize cycles, states, and justifications aligns with your visual interface roadmap.

5.  **Safety rails for pruning and spawning**
    *   Dry-run mode, human-in-the-loop thresholds, rollback/restore path for archives, sandbox enforcement by default (already in README).

6.  **Tests + CI + release hygiene**
    *   Unit tests for scoring, policy, and git actions; integration tests against a sandbox repo.
    *   GitHub Actions for lint, type-check, tests, and a release workflow producing versioned artifacts.

## Proposed architecture

*   **Core loop**
    *   Triggers → Candidate Set Builder → Annotator (optional) → Scorer → Policy Engine → Action Planner → Executors (Spawn/Prune/Merge/Archive) → Audit Log.
*   **Services**
    *   `Spawner`: forks/clones, initializes README/tags, applies naming convention, sets sandbox flag.
    *   `Pruner`: evaluates age/usage/similarity/ethics risk; merges/archives/deletes per thresholds; logs justification.
    *   `Annotator`: generates semantic tags; stores vector index to speed dedup/merge.
    *   `Curator`: groups similars into bundles; flags contradictions/outdated knowledge.
    *   `Policy/Ethics`: integrates QuantaEthos for gatekeeping; every decision carries a policy verdict and rationale.
    *   `Scheduler`: driven by QuantaParent intervals, with backpressure control.
    *   `LLM Adapter`: encapsulates LLaMA.cpp calls with timeouts and cost/latency tracking.

## Core data models (example)

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Literal

DecisionType = Literal["PRUNE", "MERGE", "ARCHIVE", "DELETE", "SPAWN", "NOOP"]

@dataclass
class RepoRecord:
    id: str
    name: str
    created_at: datetime
    last_activity_at: datetime
    usage_score: float
    ethics_risk: float
    tags: List[str]
    sandbox: bool
    metadata: Dict[str, str]

@dataclass
class PruneDecision:
    repo_id: str
    decision: DecisionType
    score: float
    reasons: List[str]
    policy_verdict: Literal["ALLOW", "REVIEW", "BLOCK"]
    confidence: float
    created_at: datetime
    dry_run: bool
    undo_token: Optional[str]
```

## Scoring and policy

*   Composite pruning score: prioritize repos with low utility and high redundancy, penalize ethics risk.

\[ \text{prune\_score} = w_u \cdot (1 - \text{usage}) + w_a \cdot \text{age\_norm} + w_r \cdot \text{redundancy} + w_e \cdot \text{ethics\_risk} \]

*   Decision thresholds:
    *   If (\text{prune_score} \ge \tau_{\text{archive}}) and ethics OK → Archive/Merge.
    *   If (\tau_{\text{review}} \le \text{prune_score} < \tau_{\text{archive}}) → Human review.
    *   Else → Keep/Noop.
*   Reinforcement signals: update weights (w_{*}) from outcomes (false positives/negatives) and QuantaEthos guidance, aligning with your roadmap to refine thresholds using ethical factors.

## Config schema and validation

*   From README (sample YAML keys): `pruning intervals`, `age thresholds`, `min usage`, `auto-merge`, `ethical filter`, `trigger types`, `repo_types`, `sandbox_only`.
*   Provide a JSON Schema and validate at startup; allow env var overrides for ops.

```yaml
pruning:
  interval_minutes: 90
  age_threshold_days: 30
  min_usage_score: 3
  auto_merge_similars: true
  ethical_filter: true
spawning:
  trigger_types: ["repeated_failures", "knowledge_gap", "missing_util"]
  repo_types: ["script", "doc", "tool"]
  sandbox_only: true
```

*   Add versioned config and a migration note in docs.

## Observability and audit

*   **Structured logs**: `event_name`, `repo_id`, `decision`, `score`, `policy_verdict`, `duration_ms`, `actor`, `dry_run`.
*   **Metrics**: prunes/hour, spawns/hour, false-positive rate (restores), mean decision latency, ethics blocks, dedup efficiency.
*   **Audit ledger**: append-only JSONL/Parquet with signed entries; export to the dashboard.

## Executors and git operations

*   **Idempotent actions**: safe retries with backoff; detect pre-existing forks/archives.
*   **Dry-run**: generate decisions and diffs without side effects.
*   **Archive pathing**: use naming convention from README (`archive-<timestamp>-<repo_name>`).
*   **Merge/squash strategy**: preserve history when merging similars; attach curation notes.

## Semantic annotator and curator

*   **Embedding index**: maintain a lightweight vector store per org; update on changes.
*   **Tagging**: file-level and repo-level topics; store tags in repo topics and a manifest for search.
*   **Contradiction/outdated flags**: compare embeddings + timestamps; route to review queue.

## Distributed pruning clusters (roadmap-ready)

*   **Coordination**: leader election or lease-based scheduling; per-repo locks to avoid double actions.
*   **Consistency**: write decisions to a shared audit bus; executors apply with optimistic concurrency.
*   **Health**: gossip heartbeat and shard assignment for scale.

This aligns with your plan for federated deployments and multi-agent environments.

## Security and ethics

*   **Policy engine**: explicit allow/block/review rules; provenance tracking; redlines enforced before action.
*   **Human-in-the-loop**: require approvals for destructive actions above a sensitivity threshold.
*   **Sandbox enforcement**: default true, per README; require manual promotion to production repos.

## Documentation upgrades

*   `docs/`
    *   Overview, architecture, sequence diagrams (text + mermaid), module guides.
    *   Ops runbook (config, dry-run, rollback), security model, audit format.
    *   Roadmap mapped to milestones (see below).
*   `README`
    *   Add quickstart, minimal example (dry-run), CLI usage, config reference, and dashboard preview.
*   **Topics & description**: add “knowledge-management”, “autonomous-agents”, “repository-pruning”, “semantic-indexing”.

## Testing and CI/CD

*   **Tests**: unit (scoring, policy, config), integration (sandbox repo), property tests (idempotency), golden logs for audit.
*   **Quality gates**: type-check, lint, security scan; coverage threshold.
*   **Releases**: tag and changelog; pre-release channel for experimental features; no releases currently exist.

## Minimal dashboard (incremental)

*   **MVP**: read-only view of decisions, filters, and repo health scores; trigger manual review/undo.
*   **Metrics panel**: time series for spawn/prune, block rates, and latency.
*   **Trace links**: drill into decision rationale (inputs, scores, policy verdict, LLM notes), directly supporting your visual interface goal.

## 30‑60‑90 day plan

*   **30 days (Foundations)**
    *   Repo reorg into modules, typed models, config schema and validation.
    *   Structured logging + audit ledger, dry-run mode, unit tests, basic CI.
    *   `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, topics/description on GitHub.

*   **60 days (Decisions & Visibility)**
    *   Composite scoring function with thresholds; human-in-the-loop review queue.
    *   Semantic annotator MVP with tagging + dedup.
    *   Dashboard MVP (read-only), sandbox-only enforcement, integration with QuantaEthos allow/block path.

*   **90 days (Scale & Feedback)**
    *   Outcome-driven weight updates; restore/rollback tooling with SLAs.
    *   Distributed scheduling (single leader) + per-repo locks.
    *   Pre-release versioning and published release notes (none exist yet).

## Acceptance metrics

*   ≤ 1% unintended deletions (measured by restores per 90 days).
*   ≥ 30% reduction in duplicate repos within 60 days.
*   ≥ 50% of pruning decisions carry human-readable justifications and policy verdicts.
*   P95 decision latency ≤ 2s in dry-run; ≤ 10s end-to-end when executing actions.
*   Dashboard reflects new decisions within 5s; zero missing audit entries.

## Risks and mitigations

*   **Over‑pruning and knowledge loss**: dry-run + review gates; conservative thresholds; easy restores.
*   **Model drift/hallucinations**: cap LLM influence to advice; require policy pass; cache decisions.
*   **Ethical drift**: periodic policy audits; QuantaEthos as a blocking authority; immutable audit.
*   **Coordination bugs in distributed mode**: per-repo locks, idempotency, and leases before sharding widely.

## Final thought

“Glia is not the spark, but it feeds the fire.” Your system can become the quiet force that keeps the knowledge alive, lean, and honest—if every decision is explainable, reversible, and measured. Ready to pick one PR to start with?
