# Proposed Enhancements for QuantaGlia-Pruner

## Learning & Adaptation
- [ ] **Similarity Analysis:** Use NLP techniques to analyze the content of READMEs and other documents to identify redundant or similar repositories.
- [ ] **Dependency Graph:** Build a dependency graph of the repositories in the knowledge base to avoid pruning repositories that are dependencies of others. This could be done by parsing dependency files.
- [ ] **Usage-Based Pruning:** Integrate more tightly with QuantaSensa to get fine-grained data on which pieces of knowledge are being actively used, and use this as a primary factor in pruning decisions.

## Resilience Features
- [x] **Dry Run Mode:** Add a "dry run" mode to the pruner that simulates pruning actions and logs what would have been done without actually performing any destructive operations.
- [x] **Configurable Pruning Strategies:** Allow users to define different pruning strategies in the `config.yaml`, such as "conservative" (archive only), "aggressive" (delete aggressively), or "balanced".

## Interoperability
- [ ] **Webhook Notifications:** When a repository is pruned, send a webhook notification to a specified URL, allowing other systems to react to the change.
- [x] **Human-in-the-Loop:** For borderline cases, instead of making an autonomous decision, the pruner could flag the repository for human review and wait for approval before taking action.

# Proposed Enhancements for QuantaGlia-Harvester

## Configuration
- [ ] **Selective File Extraction:** Add a configuration option to limit the file search to specific directories (e.g., `["/", "/docs"]`) or a specific depth to avoid inefficiently scanning very large repositories.
- [ ] **Configurable Logging Verbosity:** Implement a `log_level` setting in `config.yaml` (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`) to allow users to control the verbosity of the `quantaglia.log` file.

## Functionality
- [ ] **Robust Local Path Handling:** Improve the script to reliably handle local filesystem paths (`../my-repo`) in addition to remote Git URLs, making it more flexible for local development and testing.
- [ ] **File Content Summarization:** Instead of storing the entire raw content of discovered files, add an option to process and store a summary (e.g., the first N lines, or a summary generated by a text processing library). This would make the "knowledge base" more distilled.

# Proposed Enhancements for Reporting & Analytics

## Deeper Code Insights
- [ ] **Code Quality Metrics:** Integrate static analysis tools to report on metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, and maintainability index. This would provide a deeper understanding of the codebase's health.
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis:** Scan for dependency files and report on the number and types of dependencies used. This could highlight outdated or insecure dependencies.
- [ ] **Tech Stack Identification:** Analyze file extensions and content to automatically identify the primary programming languages and technologies used in a repository.

## Activity & Collaboration Metrics
- [ ] **Contributor Analysis:** Analyze the git history to report on metrics like the number of unique contributors, commit frequency, and recent commit activity. This can help gauge the project's level of activity and community engagement.
- [ ] **Issue & PR Metrics:** If connected to a Git hosting service API, pull in metrics on open vs. closed issues, pull request merge times, and discussion volume.

## Visualization & Usability
- [ ] **Interactive Dashboards:** Instead of a static CSV, create an interactive web-based dashboard to visualize the collected data with charts and graphs.
- [ ] **Historical Data Analysis:** Store reporting data from multiple runs to track trends over time. This would allow for visualizing how repository size, code quality, or contributor activity changes.
- [ ] **Email/Slack Summaries:** Add an option to send a summary of the report to a specified email address or Slack channel for easier consumption by teams.

# Comprehensive Feature Roadmap

## Core Harvester Functionality
- [ ] **Multi-VCS Support:** Extend cloning capabilities to support other Version Control Systems.
- [ ] **Git History Analysis:** Extract metadata from git history, such as commit frequency, author activity, and file churn, to better assess repository health.
- [ ] **Structured File Parsing:** Natively parse structured files to build a dependency graph of the knowledge base.
- [ ] **Binary File Handling:** Implement metadata extraction for non-text files (e.g., EXIF data from images, properties from PDFs) instead of just ignoring them.
- [ ] **Incremental Harvesting:** Develop a mechanism to re-scan only the changed files within a repository since the last harvest, improving efficiency for large, active repos.

## Pruner Functionality
- [ ] **Pruning Sandbox:** Create a "sandbox" mode where pruning strategies can be tested against the knowledge base without performing any destructive actions.
- [ ] **Code Quality Pruning:** Integrate static analysis tools to enable pruning strategies based on code quality metrics like cyclomatic complexity or number of code smells.
- [ ] **Flexible Archiving Backends:** Allow configuration of different archiving destinations, such as cloud storage or network drives, instead of just local deletion.
- [ ] **Community Metrics Pruning:** Factor in community activity metrics from code hosting platforms (e.g., stars, forks, issue response time) into pruning decisions.
- [ ] **Interactive Pruning Mode:** Add a CLI mode that prompts a human for confirmation on each pruning decision, showing a summary and a recommendation.

## System Integration & Architecture
- [ ] **Daemonization:** Re-architect the script to run as a persistent, background daemon or service for continuous operation.
- [ ] **API:** Implement an API for more flexible and efficient querying of the knowledge base.
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration:** Provide webhooks or plugins to allow CI/CD systems to trigger harvesting or pruning runs automatically after builds or deployments.
- [ ] **Federated Architecture:** Design a system for multiple QuantaGlia instances to communicate, share knowledge, and coordinate actions across a distributed network.
- [ ] **Event-Driven Communication:** Move from script-based execution to an event-driven model using a message bus for robust, asynchronous inter-module communication.
