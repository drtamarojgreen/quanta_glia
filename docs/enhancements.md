# Proposed Enhancements for QuantaGlia-Pruner

## Learning & Adaptation
- [ ] **Similarity Analysis:** Use NLP techniques (e.g., doc2vec, TF-IDF) to analyze the content of READMEs and other documents to identify redundant or similar repositories.
- [ ] **Dependency Graph:** Build a dependency graph of the repositories in the knowledge base to avoid pruning repositories that are dependencies of others. This could be done by parsing `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, etc.
- [ ] **Usage-Based Pruning:** Integrate more tightly with QuantaSensa to get fine-grained data on which pieces of knowledge are being actively used, and use this as a primary factor in pruning decisions.

## Resilience Features
- [ ] **Dry Run Mode:** Add a "dry run" mode to the pruner that simulates pruning actions and logs what would have been done without actually performing any destructive operations.
- [ ] **Configurable Pruning Strategies:** Allow users to define different pruning strategies in the `config.yaml`, such as "conservative" (archive only), "aggressive" (delete aggressively), or "balanced".

## Interoperability
- [ ] **Webhook Notifications:** When a repository is pruned, send a webhook notification to a specified URL, allowing other systems to react to the change.
- [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop:** For borderline cases, instead of making an autonomous decision, the pruner could flag the repository for human review and wait for approval before taking action.
