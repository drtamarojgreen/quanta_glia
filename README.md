# QuantaGlia: Dynamic Knowledge Pruner

> **Disclaimer:** This README describes the aspirational goals and architecture of the QuantaGlia project. The current implementation is in a very early stage, and most of the features described below (such as repository spawning, intelligent pruning, and the multi-repository workspace) are not yet implemented. The only functional piece is a simple information-harvesting script in `scripts/quanta_glia.py`. Please refer to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block within that script for example usage.

QuantaGlia is a modular subsystem within the PrismQuanta framework designed to autonomously collect, curate, and evolve knowledge repositories through intelligent spawning and pruning. It ensures the knowledge base remains relevant, efficient, and focused on the mission at hand.

## 🚀 Workspace Setup and Testing

This project serves as the primary entry point for setting up and testing the entire PrismQuanta ecosystem.

### Workflow and Directory Structure

The bootstrapping and testing process is designed to create a clean, multi-repository workspace.

1.  **Initial Clone**: First, clone the `quanta_glia` repository into a dedicated workspace directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/drtamarojgreen/quanta_glia.git
    ```

2.  **Run the Bootstrapper**: Navigate into the new directory and execute the `bootstrap.sh` script.
    > **Note:** Currently, the `bootstrap.sh` script is an empty placeholder and will not clone any other repositories. The multi-repository workspace described below is a future goal.
    ```bash
    cd quanta_glia
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ```

3.  **Run Tests**:
    > **Note:** There are currently no tests to run. The `test_workspace.sh` script mentioned in the original documentation does not exist, and its replacement, `scripts/test_all.sh`, is an empty placeholder.
    >
    > The following section describes the **aspirational design** for the future testing process.

    ---

    #### Future Testing Design

    After a future implementation of the `bootstrap.sh` script, the workspace would have the following structure:
    ```text
    workspace/
    ├── prismquanta/
    ├── quanta_dorsa/
    ├── quanta_ethos/
    ├── quanta_glia/      <-- You are here
    ├── quanta_porto/
    ├── quanta_sensa/
    └── quanta_synapse/
    ```

    At that point, the entire test suite could be run from the `quanta_glia` directory using a convenience script:
    ```bash
    ./test_workspace.sh
    ```

## Core Purpose

QuantaGlia simulates the behavior of biological glial cells: maintaining system health by pruning unused connections, fostering the growth of productive knowledge, and dynamically reorganizing structures based on learning outcomes.

## Key Functions

### 1. **Repository Spawner**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Clones or forks new lightweight repositories based on identified gaps in knowledge.
- Automatically tags each repo with intent, utility, and dependencies.
- Supports different repo types (code, documentation, datasets).

### 2. **Pruner**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Periodically evaluates repositories for redundancy, obsolescence, or low impact.
- Merges, archives, or deletes based on configurable thresholds.
- Logs all pruning decisions with justification.

### 3. **Semantic Annotator**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Annotates code, scripts, and documentation with contextual tags.
- Improves discoverability and thematic coherence of the knowledge base.

### 4. **Knowledge Curator**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Aggregates similar repositories into unified knowledge bundles.
- Identifies contradictory or outdated knowledge and flags it for review.

### 5. **Trigger-Based Behavior**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Learns from agent activity (e.g., frequent command patterns, repeated questions).
- Spawns new utilities (scripts, man-page digests, analysis tools) in response.

## Enhancement Roadmap

### 🧠 Learning Capabilities

- Integrate reinforcement signals from QuantaSensa and QuantaEthos.
- Refine spawning/pruning thresholds using weighted ethical factors.

### 🔄 Recursive Knowledge Bootstrapping

- Enable QuantaGlia to recursively improve its own strategies by analyzing the outcomes of prior spawn/prune cycles.

### 🕸️ Distributed Pruning Clusters

- Support federated deployments where multiple QuantaGlia nodes coordinate.
- Ideal for multi-agent or distributed environments.

### ⚖️ Ethical Regulation Tuning

- Work with QuantaEthos to ensure that spawned repos align with ethical guardrails.

### 🔍 Visual Interface

- Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize pruning cycles, knowledge flows, and current repo health.

## System Integration

| Component    | Interaction Type    | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| QuantaSensa  | Learns from actions | Detects needs based on workflow patterns        |
| QuantaEthos  | Ethics enforcement  | Rejects or flags unethical knowledge branches   |
| QuantaParent | Schedules execution | Manages spawn/prune intervals and system load   |
| LLaMA.cpp    | LLM backend         | Uses internal LLM to reason about knowledge use |

## Sample Configuration (YAML)

> **Note:** The configuration is not yet integrated into the main script. The `config.yaml` file contains the following placeholder values.

```yaml
# Configuration for QuantaGlia Pruner
pruning:
  age_threshold_days: 30
```

### Future Configuration Example

```yaml
pruning:
  interval_minutes: 90
  age_threshold_days: 30
  min_usage_score: 3
  auto_merge_similars: true
  ethical_filter: true

spawning:
  trigger_types: ["repeated_failures", "knowledge_gap", "missing_util"]
  repo_types: ["script", "doc", "tool"]
  sandbox_only: true
```

---

## Naming Convention

- `glia-<function>-<timestamp>` for spawned utilities
- `archive-<repo>-<pruned-reason>` for pruned bundles

---

## License & Compliance

- All activity is subject to PrismQuanta's ethical and audit policies.
- Repositories are to remain in the sandbox unless human-reviewed.

---

## Final Thought

QuantaGlia is more than a tool—it's a neural helper, sustaining a logical and evolving digital ecosystem. When tuned with ethical priorities and thoughtful constraints, it ensures that only the most valuable knowledge survives and grows.
