## Current Status

QuantaGlia is a modular subsystem within the PrismQuanta framework designed to autonomously collect, curate, and evolve knowledge repositories.

> **Project State:** This project is in an early, functional stage. While the ambitious roadmap for intelligent pruning and spawning is still under development, the core components for workspace setup, information harvesting, and testing are operational.
>
> - **Implemented:**
>   - A "knowledge harvester" script (`scripts/quanta_glia.py`) that clones repositories and extracts key files.
>   - A multi-repository bootstrap script (`scripts/bootstrap.sh`) to set up the full PrismQuanta workspace.
>   - A comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test_all.sh`) that validates the workspace and the harvester script.
> - **Aspirational:**
>   - Fully autonomous pruning, spawning, and semantic annotation.
>   - Integration with other Quanta systems for learning and ethical governance.

## üöÄ Quickstart

The only functional component is an information-harvesting script that clones repositories and extracts key files.


### Workflow and Directory Structure

1.  **Initial Clone**: First, clone the `quanta_glia` repository into a dedicated workspace directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/drtamarojgreen/quanta_glia.git
    ```

2.  **Run the Bootstrapper**: Navigate into the new directory and execute the `bootstrap.sh` script. This will clone all required PrismQuanta repositories into the parent directory.
    ```bash
    cd quanta_glia
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    The script can be run with one or more repository URLs as arguments. It will clone them and save extracted documents to the `knowledge_base` directory.

    ```bash
    # Example: Harvest information from one of the PrismQuanta repositories
    python3 scripts/quanta_glia.py https://github.com/drtamarojgreen/quanta_ethos.git
    ```
    You can also point it to a local directory:
    ```bash
    # The script will copy the local directory to its cache for processing
    python3 scripts/quanta_glia.py ../some_local_repo
    
    This sets up the following workspace structure:
    ```text
    workspace/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prismquanta/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quanta_alarma/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quanta_cerebra/
    # ... and all other PrismQuanta repositories
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quanta_glia/     <-- You are here
    ```

3.  **Run the Test Suite**: A master test script is provided to validate the entire workspace setup and the functionality of the `quanta_glia` scripts. To run all tests, execute:
    ```bash
    # From within the quanta_glia directory
    bash scripts/test_all.sh
    ```
    This script will:
    - Run the bootstrap script again (safely).
    - Execute a self-contained integration test for the harvester.
    - Run a workplace test against a sibling repository.
    - Attempt to run tests within all other cloned repositories.

## Core Purpose

QuantaGlia simulates the behavior of biological glial cells: maintaining system health by pruning unused connections, fostering the growth of productive knowledge, and dynamically reorganizing structures based on learning outcomes.

## Key Functions

### 1. **Repository Spawner**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Clones or forks new lightweight repositories based on identified gaps in knowledge.
- Automatically tags each repo with intent, utility, and dependencies.
- Supports different repo types (code, documentation, datasets).

### 2. **Pruner**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Periodically evaluates repositories for redundancy, obsolescence, or low impact.
- Merges, archives, or deletes based on configurable thresholds.
- Logs all pruning decisions with justification.

### 3. **Semantic Annotator**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Annotates code, scripts, and documentation with contextual tags.
- Improves discoverability and thematic coherence of the knowledge base.

### 4. **Knowledge Curator**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Aggregates similar repositories into unified knowledge bundles.
- Identifies contradictory or outdated knowledge and flags it for review.

### 5. **Trigger-Based Behavior**
> **Status:** Not yet implemented. This section describes a planned feature.

- Learns from agent activity (e.g., frequent command patterns, repeated questions).
- Spawns new utilities (scripts, man-page digests, analysis tools) in response.

## Enhancement Roadmap

### üß† Learning Capabilities

- Integrate reinforcement signals from QuantaSensa and QuantaEthos.
- Refine spawning/pruning thresholds using weighted ethical factors.

### üîÑ Recursive Knowledge Bootstrapping

- Enable QuantaGlia to recursively improve its own strategies by analyzing the outcomes of prior spawn/prune cycles.

### üï∏Ô∏è Distributed Pruning Clusters

- Support federated deployments where multiple QuantaGlia nodes coordinate.
- Ideal for multi-agent or distributed environments.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Regulation Tuning

- Work with QuantaEthos to ensure that spawned repos align with ethical guardrails.

### üîç Visual Interface

- Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize pruning cycles, knowledge flows, and current repo health.

## System Integration

| Component    | Interaction Type    | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| QuantaSensa  | Learns from actions | Detects needs based on workflow patterns        |
| QuantaEthos  | Ethics enforcement  | Rejects or flags unethical knowledge branches   |
| QuantaParent | Schedules execution | Manages spawn/prune intervals and system load   |
| LLaMA.cpp    | LLM backend         | Uses internal LLM to reason about knowledge use |

---

## Sample Configuration (YAML)

The behavior of the `quanta_glia.py` script is controlled by `config.yaml`. The script reads this file at runtime to determine which directories to use, what files to look for, and whether to enable features like summarization.

### Active Configuration

The following keys in `config.yaml` are currently in use:

```yaml
# Configuration for QuantaGlia System
main:
  knowledge_base: "./knowledge_base"
  repo_cache: "./repo_cache"
  target_topics:
    - "README"
    - "docs"
    - "ethics"
    - "usage"
  max_repos: 10

# Configuration for LLaMA.cpp integration
llamacpp:
  url: "http://localhost:8080/completion"
  enabled: false
```

### Future Configuration

The `pruning` section and other keys exist as placeholders for future development. An example of a more advanced future configuration is shown below:

```yaml
pruning:
  interval_minutes: 90
  age_threshold_days: 30
  min_usage_score: 3
  auto_merge_similars: true
  ethical_filter: true

spawning:
  trigger_types: ["repeated_failures", "knowledge_gap", "missing_util"]
  repo_types: ["script", "doc", "tool"]
  sandbox_only: true
```

## Final Thought

QuantaGlia is more than a tool‚Äîit's a neural helper, sustaining a logical and evolving digital ecosystem. When tuned with ethical priorities and thoughtful constraints, it ensures that only the most valuable knowledge survives and grows.
