# QuantaGlia: Dynamic Knowledge Pruner

QuantaGlia is a modular subsystem within the PrismQuanta framework designed to autonomously collect, curate, and evolve knowledge repositories through intelligent spawning and pruning. It ensures the knowledge base remains relevant, efficient, and focused on the mission at hand.

---

## Core Purpose

QuantaGlia simulates the behavior of biological glial cells: maintaining system health by pruning unused connections, fostering the growth of productive knowledge, and dynamically reorganizing structures based on learning outcomes.

---

## Key Functions

### 1. **Repository Spawner**

- Clones or forks new lightweight repositories based on identified gaps in knowledge.
- Automatically tags each repo with intent, utility, and dependencies.
- Supports different repo types (code, documentation, datasets).

### 2. **Pruner**

- Periodically evaluates repositories for redundancy, obsolescence, or low impact.
- Merges, archives, or deletes based on configurable thresholds.
- Logs all pruning decisions with justification.

### 3. **Semantic Annotator**

- Annotates code, scripts, and documentation with contextual tags.
- Improves discoverability and thematic coherence of the knowledge base.

### 4. **Knowledge Curator**

- Aggregates similar repositories into unified knowledge bundles.
- Identifies contradictory or outdated knowledge and flags it for review.

### 5. **Trigger-Based Behavior**

- Learns from agent activity (e.g., frequent command patterns, repeated questions).
- Spawns new utilities (scripts, man-page digests, analysis tools) in response.

## Enhancement Roadmap

### üß† Learning Capabilities

- Integrate reinforcement signals from QuantaSensa and QuantaEthos.
- Refine spawning/pruning thresholds using weighted ethical factors.

### üîÑ Recursive Knowledge Bootstrapping

- Enable QuantaGlia to recursively improve its own strategies by analyzing the outcomes of prior spawn/prune cycles.

### üï∏Ô∏è Distributed Pruning Clusters

- Support federated deployments where multiple QuantaGlia nodes coordinate.
- Ideal for multi-agent or distributed environments.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Regulation Tuning

- Work with QuantaEthos to ensure that spawned repos align with ethical guardrails.

### üîç Visual Interface

- Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize pruning cycles, knowledge flows, and current repo health.

## System Integration

| Component    | Interaction Type    | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| QuantaSensa  | Learns from actions | Detects needs based on workflow patterns        |
| QuantaEthos  | Ethics enforcement  | Rejects or flags unethical knowledge branches   |
| QuantaParent | Schedules execution | Manages spawn/prune intervals and system load   |
| LLaMA.cpp    | LLM backend         | Uses internal LLM to reason about knowledge use |

---

## Sample Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
pruning:
  interval_minutes: 90
  age_threshold_days: 30
  min_usage_score: 3
  auto_merge_similars: true
  ethical_filter: true

spawning:
  trigger_types: ["repeated_failures", "knowledge_gap", "missing_util"]
  repo_types: ["script", "doc", "tool"]
  sandbox_only: true
```

---

## Naming Convention

- `glia-<function>-<timestamp>` for spawned utilities
- `archive-<repo>-<pruned-reason>` for pruned bundles

---

## License & Compliance

- All activity is subject to PrismQuanta's ethical and audit policies.
- Repositories are to remain in the sandbox unless human-reviewed.

---

## Final Thought

QuantaGlia is more than a tool‚Äîit's a neural helper, sustaining a logical and evolving digital ecosystem. When tuned with ethical priorities and thoughtful constraints, it ensures that only the most valuable knowledge survives and grows.
