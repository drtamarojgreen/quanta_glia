# SORREL Lifecycle Map: Disciplined AI-Assisted Development

This map illustrates the interaction between Developers (Humans), AI Agents, and the SORREL System components throughout the development lifecycle, guided by the Sip Principle.

**Explanation of Flow:**

1.  **Human Developer (HD):** Initiates by defining the high-level vision and requirements for the software. This is captured in a **Situation (SIT)** artifact.
2.  **AI Agent - Understanding Mode (AI_U):** The AI agent begins by reading the current **Situation (SIT)**, existing **Facts (FACTS)**, and all governing **Rules**. It uses this to build situational awareness.
3.  **AI Agent - Planning Mode (AI_P):** Based on its understanding, the AI proposes the next *minimal sip* \u2014 the smallest, most impactful increment of work.
4.  **SORREL Reasoning Gate System (SORREL_RGS):** This acts as a checkpoint. It validates the AI's proposed plan against the Situation's constraints and the SORREL Discovery Rule.
    *   If the plan is **rejected** (e.g., violates a constraint, too broad), the AI agent returns to **Planning Mode (AI_P)** to revise its approach.
    *   If the plan is **validated**, it proceeds to the Restrictions Engine.
    *   *(Human Developer can optionally intervene here for complex rejections)*
5.  **SORREL Restrictions Engine (SORREL_SRE):** Enforces strict sip constraints (e.g., one capability, no placeholders, no hardcoded paths).
    *   If constraints are **violated**, the AI agent returns to **Planning Mode (AI_P)**.
    *   If constraints are **met**, the AI proceeds to **Coding Mode**.
6.  **AI Agent - Coding Mode (AI_C):** The AI generates the minimal C++ artifact (e.g., a Card's source code) for the approved sip. This new code forms a **Card (CARDS)**.
7.  **SORREL Card Runner (SORREL_RUN):** The system's runner takes the generated **Card (CARDS)** and executes it against the **Environment (SORREL_ENV)**.
8.  **Observe Results (SORREL_OBS):** The SORREL system observes and captures the empirical output of the Card's execution, forming **Card Results (RESULTS)**.
9.  **Record Fact (SORREL_REC):** If the **Card Results (RESULTS)** verify a new piece of knowledge, the SORREL system records this as an immutable entry in **Facts (FACTS)**.
10. **Update Checkins (SORREL_CHECK):** For any conceptual or unimplemented parts of the work, the `sorrel_checkins.md` (**CHECKINS**) file is updated.
11. **AI Agent - Understanding Mode (AI_U):** The AI agent consumes the newly recorded **Facts (FACTS)** and **Card Results (RESULTS)**, updating its understanding of the environment and state. This completes one sip cycle, leading to the next iteration of planning.

**Human Developer Oversight (dashed lines):** The human continuously monitors and can intervene at various points, especially during Reasoning Gate and Restrictions Engine checks, or by reviewing Observations and Facts. This ensures the AI remains aligned with the overall vision without micromanagement.

## Checkin/Checkout Traceability Rule

SDD lifecycle governance relies on two files:
- **`sorrel_checkins.md`** captures what is still pending.
- **`sorrel_checkouts.md`** captures what has been done and verified.

This pairing provides end-to-end traceability across lifecycle stages and enforces evidence-based progress reporting.
